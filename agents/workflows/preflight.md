# Preflight Build Sanity Check

Follow `.agents/rules/harness-rules.md`.

## Steps

1. `python .agents/scripts/preflight_check.py` — includes a cached `_hook_selftest.py` run when harness files changed.
2. If it fails, stop. If it passes: if test files (`*Test.kt`) were modified or added, audit quality with `test-quality-reviewer-agent`, then run targeted tests and `python .agents/scripts/run_gradle_task.py :app:assembleDebug` — only after the required-reviewer review when code changed.
