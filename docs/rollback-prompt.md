# Rollback prompt

> **Raw Prompt URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabee-elkholy/android-agent-harness/v0.27.14/docs/rollback-prompt.md`  
> **Kit Repository**: `https://github.com/rabee-elkholy/android-agent-harness.git`
> **Kit version**: `v0.27.14` — **SHA-256**: `ca58a61185a2701a74a35c51faeea97ee3c3bda4ac6ed720059ff5617153a3b8` (SHA-256 of every byte after this line; verify first — mismatch = STOP)
Paste **this entire file** to the agent if you want the previous system restored.

---
Before executing anything: verify that the SHA-256 of every byte after the **SHA-256** header line equals the header value. If it does not match, STOP and tell the developer the file was tampered with.

You are rolling back the Android AI harness install on THIS checkout. The developer may use **any** coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, Cursor, Copilot, Qwen, Windsurf, Cline, Kilo, Goose, …) on **macOS**, **Windows**, or **Linux**.

Backups: `<repo>/.harness-backup/` and `$HOME/.harness-backups/` (or `$HOME/.gemini/harness-backups/`) as recorded in `MANIFEST.md`.

## Rules

- Do **not** delete backup folders.
- Do **not** restore `local.properties`, Android SDK, or Gradle caches.
- Do **not** commit unless asked.
- Answer in the developer's language.
- After restore, they must start a **new** chat session in the same tool.

## Steps

1. Open the newest `.harness-backup/*/MANIFEST.md` unless they name a timestamp. Print the path.
2. Follow the manifest exactly.
3. Project restore:
   - `.agents` from `project-agents`, or delete `.agents` if it did not exist
   - `.claude` / `.codex` / `.cursor` / `.github` / `.windsurf` / `.roo` / `.amazonq` / `.continue` / `.junie` / `.kilocode` the same way if those backup folders exist
   - overwrite repo-root files from `project-root-files/` (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `CODEX.md`, `QWEN.md`, `.clinerules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.goosehints`, …)
4. User-config restore from `geminiBackupPath` / user backup path in the manifest only for files that existed before:
   - `~/.gemini/config/config.json` and `rules/`
   - `~/.claude/settings.json` and `settings.local.json`
   - `~/.codex/config.toml` (or json)
   - If a file did **not** exist before: delete only what this kit added. Never wipe `~/.claude` or `~/.gemini` entirely.
5. Confirm restored paths in chat.

If no backup exists, stop. Do not invent files.
