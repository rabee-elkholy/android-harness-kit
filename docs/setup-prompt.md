# Setup prompt

> **Raw Prompt URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabee-elkholy/android-agent-harness/v0.28.3/docs/setup-prompt.md`  
> **Kit Repository**: `https://github.com/rabee-elkholy/android-agent-harness.git`

The installing agent **executes** this file (usually after the developer pasted [`install-or-update-prompt.md`](install-or-update-prompt.md) in a new chat on the Android app). Do not summarize it. Replacing the example app name alone is **not** a successful install.

---

You are installing a portable **Android AI harness** into THIS checkout. The kit is a checkout of an exact release tag from `android-agent-harness` (sibling, temp, or a path the developer gave). Copy from that detached tag’s `agents/` folder only after verifying `agents/VERSION` matches the requested tag. Never copy from `main`.

## Goal

Same **engine** (5-leaf review, live Gradle runner, safety hook). **Different product, machine, and team policy.** A find-replace of the example app name is **not** enough.

## Critical Installation Guardrails (Zero-Tolerance Rules)

1. **Read-Only Kit Source**: The kit directory (`<kit>` / `android-agent-harness`) is strictly **READ-ONLY**. NEVER edit, create, or modify any file in `<kit>`. All file copies, edits, patches, and configurations MUST occur strictly in the target Android repository (`<this-android-root>/.agents`).
2. **Scope Isolation (No Modifying App Source Code)**: Setup is strictly for configuring `.agents/` and AI tool rules. NEVER edit, rewrite, or modify the target application's production source code (e.g. `strings.xml`, `values-ar/strings.xml`, Kotlin files, or Room entities) to force preflight to pass. If preflight detects pre-existing issues in the app's codebase (such as untranslated strings or Room schema discrepancies), report them clearly to the developer in chat as pre-existing findings.
3. **No `schedule` Timers**: NEVER call the `schedule` tool or create background sleep/polling timers during setup. Execute commands synchronously or wait for automatic task completion via Reactive Wakeup.
4. **Mandatory Step 3b Approval (First Install Only)**: The installer MUST present the domain references table to the developer via `ask_question` modal in Step 3b during first-time installation and obtain explicit approval before finalizing setup.

Before the wizard questions, tell the developer in their language **as a warning**: this setup needs a **strong model** in this chat, not a fast/cheap one. Install is a structural port. A weak model skips steps and leaves a broken helper. Stay until `Total test failures: 0`. If this chat is a small model, **stop** and start a new chat on a stronger model. Then: setup takes a few minutes (backup, port, selftest).

Answer in the developer's language. Do not commit unless they ask.

If `<repo>/.harness-setup/answers.json` exists and `"i0": true`, **execute the deterministic engine directly**:
`$PY <kit>/agents/scripts/install_or_update.py --repo <this-android-root> --kit <kit>`
This performs sections 0 to 6 automatically in under 3 seconds.

Otherwise run `<kit>/agents/scripts/setup_wizard.py` (see [`install-or-update-prompt.md`](install-or-update-prompt.md)). Print the wizard JSON `model_warning` first, then `auto_blurb`. Ask **only** the objects in `questions`; the JSON list is the sole authority and can include I.18-I.21 plus conditional I.2/I.5/I.6/I.19/bootstrap questions. Use each JSON `prompt` **verbatim**. Do **not** invent extra I.* questions. Do **not** invent five-word titles.

**Interview format:** The developer reads the **choice UI**. One form per JSON question. Options in the **same language** as the developer. Wait for required answers. On a re-run, previous answers are marked `(current)` and Enter keeps them; only deliberate changes need a new choice. Do not guess which tools they use (I.14), Zoho (I.16), tracker (I.20), git gate (I.21), or phone vs emulator (I.4). Do not rewrite `harness-rules.md` until the required questions returned by the wizard are answered.

Python, module, launcher, APK, architecture, and locales come from disk (`auto` in the wizard JSON). Defaults you must **not** ask: scaffold disabled (I.9), Gemini = merge script grants only if `~/.gemini` exists else skip (I.12 — never write a global Gemini rule during setup), tests only at the end (I.13). The wizard adds I.2 / I.5 / I.6 **only** when Python, module, or launcher is missing or ambiguous.

**Free text only** if they pick “Other” on I.1, I.5, or I.6.

## Detect environment (print in chat)

- OS: `darwin` / Windows / Linux. Do **not** assume Mac. Never copy another PC's paths.
- Tools: Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity/Gemini, Cursor, Copilot, Qwen Code, Windsurf, Cline, Roo, Amazon Q, Continue, Junie, Kilo, Goose — whatever exists. Do not require Antigravity. Write adapters **only** for the tools they pick in **I.14**.
- **`PY`**: try `python3 --version` then `python --version`. Windows `python3` is often a failing Store stub → use `python`. Ask I.2 only if the wizard JSON includes it (both work, or none work).
- `adb` and `./gradlew` / `gradlew.bat`. On macOS `chmod +x gradlew` if needed.

## 0) Backup FIRST (mandatory)

Do not write/delete `.agents` or user AI config until either a backup exists **or** they chose start-without-backup. If they asked for a backup and copy fails, **stop**.

Ask **I.0** before copying (see section I), unless `.harness-setup/answers.json` already recorded it. If `"backup": false`, **skip file copies** and tell them rollback will not work. Then:

If `"backup"` is true or unset (default): Timestamp `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`. Prune any previous backup directories under `.harness-backup/` so that **strictly only 1 backup copy is retained** (avoiding disk bloat while guaranteeing clean rollback). **A)** `<repo>/.harness-backup/<timestamp>/` for `.agents`, `.claude`, `.codex`, `.cursor`, `.github` (copilot/instructions only if present), `.windsurf`, `.roo`, `.amazonq`, `.continue`, `.junie`, `.kilocode`, repo `.gemini`, root `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md`/`CODEX.md`/`QWEN.md`/`.cursorrules`/`.clinerules`/`.windsurfrules`/`.goosehints`. **B)** `$HOME/.harness-backups/<repo>-<timestamp>/` for `~/.gemini/config.json` + `rules/`, `~/.claude/settings*.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml` or `json` — no tokens/transcripts. Do **not** write `~/.gemini` during this install when another product on this PC already uses it (I.12). Append `.harness-backup/` to `<repo>/.git/info/exclude` (keep shared `.gitignore` untouched). Manifest with yes/no per item. Rollback = `docs/rollback-prompt.md` (copied into the backup folder).

## 1) Place the engine

Copy kit `agents/` → `.agents/`. Empty `state/`. `.agents/.gitignore` = `state/` + `cache/` + `__pycache__/` + `scripts/__pycache__/` + `mcp/*/__pycache__/` + `mcp/zoho_sprints/zoho_config.json` + `*zoho*token*` + `*.secret`. Automatically register all harness directories and local AI manifests (`.agents/`, `.harness-setup/`, `.harness-backup/`, `.harness-backups/`, `.githooks/`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `QWEN.md`, `.cursor/`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurf/`, `.windsurfrules`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.clinerules`, `.amazonq/`, `.continue/`, `.junie/`, `.kilocode/`, `.roo/`, `.goosehints`, `*.diff`, `*.patch`) in `<repo>/.git/info/exclude` (and ensure shared `.gitignore` has strictly zero harness lines) so **strictly ZERO harness or AI files ever appear in Android Studio Git or pollute shared team branches**. Transient helper scripts must execute in memory (`python -c`) or be unlinked immediately so zero unversioned files remain. Leave kit `mcp_config.json` empty until **I.16** is applied by `install_zoho_mcp.py`. Never copy a Zoho token file into the repo.

## 2) Discover from disk (do not invent)

Read Gradle, manifests, source:
- **Android Validation**: If no `gradlew`/`gradlew.bat` or no Android Gradle build files: **STOP**. Tell the developer `[ERROR] Target directory is NOT an Android project.`
- **Greenfield / Brand-New Project Support**: If the project is brand new or blank (< 4 source files, unconfigured architecture), do NOT stop! Instead, enter **Greenfield Bootstrap Mode**. The wizard `questions` payload will automatically include the detailed architectural foundation questions (`b_platform`, `b_arch`, `b_di`, `b_nav`, `b_ui`, `b_db`, `b_net`, `b_locales`) so the developer can establish their desired stack from day one.

Print a **proposed facts** table in chat (module, assemble task, APK path, applicationId, launcher, DI, VM base, Room yes/no, theme, source roots, string files). Never assume `:app` or `app-debug.apk`. If `local.properties` missing: tell them Android Studio must write `sdk.dir` — do not invent a path.

Print `model_warning` then `auto_blurb` from the wizard JSON. Then ask **only** the `questions` array (section I). Do not re-ask facts already in `auto`.

## I) Interview — only what the wizard JSON lists. The interview is organized into **4 logical stations** with smart cascading skips:

#### Station 1: Workspace & AI Tooling

### I.0 Backup? (required)
- **Modal prompt:** Setup will replace the AI helper files in this project. A backup lets you restore them if something goes wrong. Without a backup, the old files cannot be restored.
- **Choices:** `Back up and start` (Recommended) / `Start without a backup` / `Stop setup`

### I.14 Coding tools (required)
- **Modal prompt:** Which programs do you open this project in? Select every one you use. If you use Cursor, you must select Cursor so its rules get written.
- **Choices (multi-select):** `Cursor` / `Claude Code` / `GitHub Copilot` / `Gemini / Antigravity` / `Codex` / `Qwen Code` / `Windsurf` / `Cline` / `Roo` / `Amazon Q` / `Continue` / `Junie` / `Kilo` / `Goose` / `All of them`

### I.2 / I.5 / I.6 / I.19 (conditional)
- Ask only if they appear in the JSON (ambiguous Python, several app modules, several launchers, or product flavors).

#### Station 2: Git Governance & Safety

### I.3 Git (required)
- **Modal prompt:** Who should create git commits? If you are not sure, keep commits in your own hands (you commit from the IDE).
- **Choices:** `I commit myself` (Recommended) / `The agent may commit when I ask in chat`

### I.21 Pre-commit git gate (required)
- **Modal prompt:** use the wizard JSON `prompt` verbatim.
- **Choices:** install the staged quality gate (Recommended) / manage your own git hooks.
- The recommended choice passes `--git-gate` to `install_tool_adapters.py` (the default). The opt-out passes `--no-git-gate` and leaves `.githooks/pre-commit` absent.

#### Station 3: Project Management & Task Tracker

### I.20 Project tracker (required)
- **Modal prompt:** use the wizard JSON `prompt` verbatim.
- **Choices:** `zoho_sprints` / `github_projects` / `jira_mcp` / `linear_mcp` / `none`.
- Write the selected value to `_product.py` as `PM_PROVIDER`.

### I.18 Project tracker content language (cascading: skipped if I.20 = none)
- **Modal prompt:** use the wizard JSON `prompt` verbatim.
- **Choices:** English task titles + Arabic comments/descriptions / all English / all Arabic.

### I.16 Zoho Sprints (cascading: asked only if I.20 = zoho_sprints)
- **Modal prompt:** use the wizard JSON `prompt` verbatim. Setup will not ask for tokens and will not copy them.
- **Choices:** enable / skip. If a user-level Zoho config already exists on this PC, enable is recommended. Otherwise skip is recommended.

#### Station 4: Device Testing & Verification

### I.15 Unit tests? (required)
- **Modal prompt:** After the helper finishes code and review, should it run unit tests (checks logic without opening the app)? Pick no if this project has no tests and you will not add them.
- **Choices:** `Yes, run unit tests` (Recommended) / `No, skip unit tests`

### I.22 Device verification mode (required)
- **Modal prompt:** use the wizard JSON `prompt` verbatim.
- **Choices:** `Interactive Manual Smoke` (Recommended) / `Disabled` (assemble only).

### I.4 Phone or emulator? (cascading: skipped if I.22 = disabled)
- **Modal prompt:** Will you test this app on a real phone, an emulator (AVD), or both? Pick both unless you never use an emulator. Physical only blocks emulator install and logcat.
- **Choices:** `Phone and emulator both allowed` (Recommended) / `Physical phone only — no emulator`

### I.10 Ask before install? (cascading: skipped if I.22 = disabled)
- **Modal prompt:** Before the helper installs the app on the phone or emulator, should it ask you first? Asking avoids installing on the wrong device. Skipping is faster if you trust the serial.
- **Choices:** `Ask me first` (Recommended) / `Install without asking`

### Re-running after installation

If `.harness-setup/answers.json` already exists, re-run the wizard when the
developer wants to change a choice. The wizard marks stored choices as
`(current)` and Enter keeps them; a new number changes only that answer. Then
run the installer with the flags printed by the wizard and verify with
`harness_doctor.py`.

#### Zoho setup flow (only when I.16 = enable)

1. **Check for existing credentials** on this PC: `~/.android-harness/zoho_sprints.json` or `~/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/zoho_sprints/zoho_config.json`.
2. **If credentials exist:** tell the developer you found them and will reuse them. Skip to step 6.
3. **If no credentials:** ask the developer with `ask_question`:
   - `Set up Zoho credentials now` / `I will set them up later`
4. **If later:** run `$PY .agents/scripts/install_zoho_mcp.py --repo <this-android-root> --py <I.2> --tools <I.14 ids> --enable`. Tell them to fill `~/.android-harness/zoho_sprints.json` with the fields from `config.example.json` when they are ready. Skip to step 7.
5. **If now:** guide the developer through credential setup:
   - Tell them: "You need a Zoho API console self-client. Here are the steps:"
   - **Step A:** Go to https://api-console.zoho.com/ and create a **Self Client**.
   - **Step B:** Generate a grant token with scope: `ZohoSprints.sprints.ALL,ZohoSprints.items.ALL,ZohoSprints.team.READ`
   - **Step C:** Exchange the grant token for a refresh token using the Zoho OAuth endpoint.
   - **Step D:** Ask the developer for these values (one `ask_question` with free text):
     - `client_id`
     - `client_secret`
     - `refresh_token`
     - `team_id` (from their Zoho Sprints URL: `https://sprints.zoho.com/team/<team_id>/...`)
     - `project_id` (from their Zoho Sprints URL: `https://sprints.zoho.com/team/<team_id>/project/<project_id>/...`)
   - Write these to `~/.android-harness/zoho_sprints.json` in the format of `config.example.json`. Never copy this file into the repo.
6. **Wire MCP:** run `$PY .agents/scripts/install_zoho_mcp.py --repo <this-android-root> --py <I.2> --tools <I.14 ids> --enable`.
7. **Fill workflow defaults:** ask the developer:
   - What prefix to use for sprint items (e.g. `"App-I"`, `"PRJ-I"`)?
   - What names should be stripped from ticket titles (their name in English and/or Arabic)?
   - Write these to `.agents/mcp/zoho_sprints/workflow_defaults.json`. Leave `default_user_id`, `fallback_item_type_id`, `fallback_priority_id`, `fallback_sprint_id` empty — the server resolves them at runtime when blank.

### I.2 / I.5 / I.6 — only if they appear in the JSON

Ask them with the JSON `prompt` verbatim (ambiguous Python, several app modules, or several launchers).

### Do not ask (already in `auto` / answers.json)

- **I.6b / I.7 / I.8:** APK path, stack, locales from disk. Use discovered stack. Rewrite architecture skills to match **this** app (do not keep kit placeholder architecture unless it matches disk).
- **I.9:** always disable `new_feature_scaffold.py` `main()`. Keep `VIEWMODEL` / `SCREEN` constants for `_hook_selftest.py`.
- **I.11:** Exclude rules stay on the machine via `.git/info/exclude`. Helper rules stay on the machine that ran setup, even on a team. Teammates install their own copy. Do not modify shared `.gitignore` or commit `.agents` during this setup.
- **I.12:** if `~/.gemini` exists, merge script grants only. Never write a global Gemini rule during this setup.
- **I.13:** tests only (selftest + preflight). Do not run `:assembleDebug` at the end unless answers say assemble.

Record all answers in `.harness-backup/<timestamp>/SETUP_ANSWERS.md`.

## 3) Port structurally (use answers)

**Keep:** 5 reviewers; `*_PASS`; no `code-review-guard-agent`; no `LGTM`; `$PY .agents/scripts/run_gradle_task.py`; `$PY .agents/scripts/run_device.py`; do not skip reviews.

Patch **all** product constants (`docs/porting.md`): write `.agents/scripts/_product.py` from `applicationId`, launcher, assemble task, APK path, and source-root Path pieces. Rewrite `harness-rules.md` (I.1 name, I.3 git, I.4 device, I.15 tests). Glob `**/outputs/apk/debug/*.apk` if the filename is unknown. KMP: `androidMain`, not `src/main` after renaming only `"app"`. Apply **I.20** by writing the answered tracker into `.agents/scripts/_product.py` as `PM_PROVIDER` (`zoho_sprints` default keeps today's behavior; `none` disables tracker mutations). For `github_projects`, run `python .agents/scripts/pm_github.py check`; for `jira_mcp` / `linear_mcp`, point the developer at the matching `.agents/pm/mcp_registration.*.md` playbook instead of wiring anything yourself.

Apply **I.7**: rewrite or stub skills so reviewers cannot cite ads/streak/GPS/Room/MVI/Hilt/theme wrappers unless this checkout has them. See **3b** for the full reference-fill protocol. **Always disable** scaffold `main()` (keep `VIEWMODEL`/`SCREEN` constants for `_hook_selftest.py`). `logcat_doctor` / `perf_guard` / `fast_kt_lint` use **this** `applicationId` via `_product.py` and the real source roots. `run_device.py` uses **I.6**. Apply **I.4** by writing `ALLOW_EMULATOR` into `_product.py` (the safety hook honors it at runtime; no `if emulator` rewrite needed). Apply **I.3** (`GIT_POLICY`), **I.10** (`INSTALL_CONFIRM`), and **I.22** (`DEVICE_VERIFICATION_MODE`) the same way. Apply **I.15** (unit tests yes/no) in `harness-rules.md` / `deliver.md`. `harness-rules.md` uses **I.1–I.8** and git policy **I.3**. Keep the generic Zoho Sprints section; I.16 only wires MCP. **I.8:** one locale → skip AR/EN parity.

### 3b) Dynamic Domain Discovery & Custom Reference Creation (with developer approval)

The kit ships clean foundation references in `.agents/skills/android-harness/references/` (`architecture-guidelines.md`, `ui-layout-and-theming.md`, `performance-and-optimization.md`, `database-and-persistence.md`, `test-quality-guidelines.md`, `automated-skills.md`, `daily-scenarios.md`). During install, the installer agent MUST dynamically discover the project's actual core domains and create tailored reference files.

#### 1. Foundation References (Always Port & Fill):
1. **`architecture-guidelines.md`**: 
   - **For Established Codebases**: Read Gradle, `libs.versions.toml`, and ViewModels / DI modules to port DI framework, ViewModel base, Navigation, State pattern, and Layer conventions.
   - **For Greenfield / Brand-New Projects**: Write `architecture-guidelines.md` directly using the developer's recorded `bootstrap_details` (Platform, Architecture pattern, DI, Navigation, Database, Networking, Locales), establishing the clean architectural foundation for the new project from day one!

2. **`ui-layout-and-theming.md`**:
   - Detect Compose Multiplatform vs AndroidX Compose vs XML Views/Themes.
   - Document the real theme function (`AppTheme` / `MaterialTheme`), typography tokens, and preview patterns (`CompositionLocalProvider(LocalLayoutDirection...)` for KMP, `locale = "ar"` for AndroidX).

3. **`performance-and-optimization.md`**:
   - Keep generic (UI thread safety, coroutine dispatchers, memory leaks, Compose recomposition stability, sensor/background lifecycle).

4. **`database-and-persistence.md`**:
   - If `@Database` / SQLite / DataStore exists: fill with real `AppDatabase` class name, entities, or preferences schema.
   - If no database: keep a minimal note ("No local database in this project").

#### 2. References Handling: First-Time Install vs. Update Session:

- **A. During an UPDATE Session (Existing Harness)**:
  1. **Preserve Existing References AS-IS**: Do NOT overwrite, delete, or unilaterally add generic reference files. Restore all existing project reference files from `.agents/skills/android-harness/references/*.md` (or backup) exactly as they are.
  2. **Mandatory Approval Modal with Clickable Links**: Ask the developer via `ask_question` in their language to confirm keeping existing references. The installer MUST list every discovered reference file as a clickable markdown link (`[filename.md](file:///<absolute-path-to-file>)`) and explicitly instruct the developer that they can click and review any file in the IDE before confirming:
     - **Question**: "The following tailored architecture reference files were discovered in this project:
- [filename1.md](file:///path/to/references/filename1.md)
- [filename2.md](file:///path/to/references/filename2.md)
...
You can click any file above to review its contents in your IDE before deciding. Would you like to approve and keep these reference guides as-is, or reset/modify them?" (posed in the developer's language)
     - **Options**: `(Recommended) Approve and preserve all existing tailored reference files` / `Reset reference files to default kit templates` / `I want to add or modify specific domain references` (localized to the developer's language)
  3. If the developer approves, keep all reference files unchanged. If they want changes, make the requested adjustments before proceeding.

- **B. During a FIRST-TIME INSTALL**:
  1. Scan all module folders (`features/`, `core/`, `domain/`, etc.), packages, and Gradle dependencies to identify the project's actual core domains. For any major domain found in the project, **create a new dedicated reference file** in `.agents/skills/android-harness/references/`:
     - **Audio / Media**: (ExoPlayer, Media3, SoundPool, AudioPlayer) -> Create `audio-media-playback.md`
     - **Networking & API**: (Ktor client, Retrofit, WebSockets, GraphQL) -> Create `networking-api-contracts.md`
     - **Hardware / IoT / Bluetooth**: (BLE, USB, CameraX, NFC, Wi-Fi) -> Create `hardware-bluetooth-camera.md`
     - **Ads / Mediation**: (AdMob, AppLovin, UnityAds, UMP) -> Create `ad-mediation-privacy.md`
     - **Payments / Billing**: (Google Play Billing, Stripe, RevenueCat) -> Create `payment-gateways-architecture.md`
     - **Location / Maps**: (GPS, Google Maps, Mapbox, LocationManager) -> Create `location-maps-services.md`
     - **Domain-Specific Engines**: e.g., Education & Alphabet Games, Shopping Cart & Checkout, Chat & Messaging -> Create `<feature-name>-system.md`
     - **Local Storage / Caching**: (SQLDelight, KeyValueCache, DataStore) -> Create `local-cache-storage.md`
  2. **Update `daily-scenarios.md`**: Register and link to ALL active domain references (foundation + newly discovered).
  3. **Present Summary Table & Approval Modal**: Present a clear summary table to the developer and ask for approval via `ask_question`:
     - `Approve the reference files` (Recommended) / `I have changes to make`

## 4) Leftover grep

Must not find the parent-product leftovers listed in `docs/porting.md` (After port). Theme-wrapper name only if they kept it. `HARNESS_REVIEW_PACKAGE` may stay.

Do not write forbidden tokens even in “do not use …” sentences.

## 5) Wire tools

`hooks.json` lives in `.agents/` for Antigravity. Write adapters **only** for the tools from **I.14**. Run:

```
$PY .agents/scripts/install_tool_adapters.py --product <I.1> --py <I.2> --assemble <I.5 assembleDebug task> --device-policy <allow|physical-only from I.4> --git-policy <never|agent-may-commit from I.3> --pm-provider <I.20 id> --tracker-language <I.18 mode> --tools <comma ids from I.14>
```

The unit-test task is derived automatically from `--assemble` (assembleDebug → testDebugUnitTest; override with `--unit-test` when needed). `--pm-provider`/`--tracker-language` keep the Zoho defaults when omitted.

`--tools` examples: `cursor,gemini` or `claude,copilot` or `all`. Map I.14 labels to ids: `cursor` `claude` `copilot` `gemini` `codex` `qwen` `windsurf` `cline` `roo` `amazonq` `continue` `junie` `kilo` `goose`. `--tools all` if they picked every tool.

`--device-policy allow` if I.4 is both-allowed. `--device-policy physical-only` only if they locked to a physical device. `--git-policy never` unless I.3 allows commits.

That script fills `.agents/tool-adapters/*.template`, always writes `AGENTS.md`, writes the selected tool files, generates `.claude/agents/*.md` only when `claude` is selected, and **deletes** previously managed adapters for tools that were not selected. Details: kit `docs/tool-support.md`.

Then Zoho MCP from **I.16**:

```
$PY .agents/scripts/install_zoho_mcp.py --repo <this-android-root> --py <I.2> --tools <comma ids from I.14> --enable
```

Use `--disable` when I.16 is skip (or `zoho_mcp` is missing on an old answers.json). Do **not** copy token files. Do **not** write `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`.

Follow **I.12** from answers: merge script grants only when `gemini_config` is `merge-allowlist`. Do **not** write a global Gemini rule. Never copy `remoteControlHostname` or tokens. Never set `sdk.dir` in harness files. Do not overwrite `.aider.conf.yml`, Continue user configs, `kilo.jsonc`, or `~/.gemini`.

## 6) Verify & Diagnostics

1. `$PY .agents/scripts/_hook_selftest.py` → `Total test failures: 0`.  
2. `$PY .agents/scripts/preflight_check.py` → pass.  
3. `$PY .agents/scripts/harness_doctor.py` → 12-Dimension diagnostic engine (must report 0 critical failures). Validates `.gitignore` coverage for state/cache/secrets.
4. Confirm adapter files exist for **I.14** only (always `AGENTS.md`; Cursor `.mdc` starts with `---`; `GEMINI.md` if Gemini was selected). Do not require CLAUDE.md / Copilot / Cline unless those tools were chosen.  
5. Assemble only if **I.13 = yes**.

## 7) Tell the developer

- **Zero Git Pollution**: All harness files (`.agents/`), adapters (`AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursorrules`), and transient state are 100% private and excluded locally via `.git/info/exclude`. No harness commit is needed; your repository working tree remains clean for your team.
- **Local Hooks Privacy**: Note that `.githooks/` is automatically registered in `.git/info/exclude` to keep pre-commit gates local to this developer without dirtying shared team repositories.
- **New Session**: Tell them to start a **new chat** on this Android folder before starting daily work.
- **Diagnostics & Rollback**:
  - To run system diagnostics at any time: Run `python .agents/scripts/harness_doctor.py` or execute `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabee-elkholy/android-agent-harness/v0.28.3/docs/diagnostic-prompt.md`.
  - For rollback: Execute `.harness-backup/<timestamp>/rollback-prompt.md` or `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabee-elkholy/android-agent-harness/v0.28.3/docs/rollback-prompt.md`.
  - Remember: Five `*_PASS` required before real feature/bug delivery.
